# Quantify-Case-Competition
This project was prepared for the 2025 Quantify Case Competition and focuses on advising Quant Co., an integrated oil and gas company in Canada, on its transition to renewable energy. 
The analysis began by evaluating the strengths and risks of Quant Co.’s existing oil and gas operations. We then assessed the viability of expanding into solar and wind energy, using province-level data on catastrophic (CAT) events—such as hail, floods, fires, and windstorms—to identify suitable locations. 
Recognizing the financial risks posed by these events, we proposed the use of parametric insurance offered by Stronghold, which enables faster and more predictable payouts based on predefined triggers. Our final recommendations include launching pilot projects in low- to moderate-risk regions, combining parametric and traditional insurance for optimal coverage, and developing internal CAT risk analytics to support long-term strategic growth.
